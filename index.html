				<h2 class="featurette-heading">Watermelons... <span class="text-muted">They're everything you're not</span></h2>
				<p class="lead">Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus, family Cucurbitaceae) is a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) flowering plant originally from southern Africa. It is a large, sprawling annual plant with coarse, hairy pinnately-lobed leaves and white to yellow flowers. It is grown for its edible fruit, also known as a watermelon, which is a special kind of berry botanically called a pepo. The fruit has a smooth hard rind, usually green with dark green stripes or yellow spots, and a juicy, sweet interior flesh, usually deep red to pink, but sometimes orange, yellow, or white, with many seeds..</p>
				<p>Considerable breeding effort has been put into disease-resistant varieties and into developing a seedless strain. Many cultivars are available, producing mature fruit within 100 days of planting the crop. The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked.</p>

		<h3>13 reasons to eat watermelon everyday:</h3>
	</div>

	<button id="reasonListHead">View Reasons...</button>
	
	<div id="reasonList">
		<ol>
			<li>
				Healthy heart
				Eating large amounts of watermelon improves your cardiac functions. Watermelons contain high levels of a remarkable antioxidant called lycopene (hence its red color). Lycopene keeps your heart young and avoids damage done by free radicals. Next to lycopene, watermelons contain high levels of potassium which cut back the risk of a heart attack, help to reduce cholesterol, improve blood flow, and regulate your heart beat. Lycopene is one of the antioxidants mentioned in my previous article about the 9 amazing antioxidants for great health.
			</li>

			<li>
				Strong bones
				Dietary lycopene (also found in tomatoes) has been recognized to promote healthy bones. This powerful antioxidant reduces the activity of bone cells involved in the development of osteoporosis. And its high potassium levels help to retain calcium, which keeps your bones and joints healthy and strong. You may also want to read about these 4 steps to prevent osteoporosis.
			</li>

			<li>
				Boost immune system and speeds-up wound healing
				Watermelon contains high levels of vitamin C. Vitamin C strengthens your immune system and protects your body against free radicals and oxidative stress. Vitamin C also plays an important role in the healing of wounds. The enzymes involved in collagen production need vitamin C. So if your wounds aren’t healing as they should, increase your intake of vitamin C rich foods such as watermelons and citrus fruits. Find here more natural ways to boost your immune system.
			</li>
			<li>
				Aids weight loss
				Watermelon contains around 90% water and is very low in calories, making it a great fruit for people who want to lose weight. But its low calorie content is not the only reason why you should eat watermelons regularly to lose weight. Citrulline, also found in watermelons, gets converted into arginine which is an amino acid that has fat burning effect. Also read here about 12 simple tweaks for weight loss and great health.
			</li>
			<li>
				Anti-inflammatory properties
				Watermelons are rich in flavonoids, carotenoids (like lycopene), and triterpenoids. Especially lycopene has shown some great results in reducing inflammation and neutralizing free radicals. Make sure to pick ripe watermelons as they have higher amounts of these anti-inflammatory compounds. Find here more anti inflammatory foods.
			</li>
			<li>
				Prevents cancer
				Again it is lycopene who steals the show. This powerful carotenoid has been linked to reduce the risk of prostate, breast, lung, uterus, and colon cancer. Find here more foods that protect against cancer development.
			</li>
			<li>
				Alkalize your body
				These days our diets are full of acid producing foods (meat, dairy, baked goods, processed foods, and fast foods). High acidic diets have been linked to weight gain and an increased risk of developing diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and heart diseases. Ripe watermelons are very alkaline and help your body to neutralize these harmful and damaging acids.
			</li>
			<li>
				Healthy Muscles and Nerves
				Watermelon is a good sources of potassium and citrulline to keep your muscles and nerves working properly. It controls the contraction of your muscles and avoids muscle soreness after tough workouts. Our body converts citrulline to arginine, which helps to relax blood vessels and improves circulation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Improves vision
				Eating plenty of watermelon is good for your eye health, due to its high levels of antioxidants like beta carotene, vitamin-C, lutein, and zeaxanthin. They will protect your eyes against age-related issues like night blindness, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Find here more information about preventing eyesight problems and improving vision naturally.

	<h3>Interesting watermelon facts</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Sugar Baby The comparatively small (nine to 13 pounds) sugar baby is often referred to as an icebox watermelon. Developed in 1955, it has soft, sweet fruit and a dark green rind.</li>
		<li>Sangria Developed in 1985, this supersize variety is beloved for its scarlet-colored, nonfibrous flesh. The melon's popularity has diminished recently owing to a demand for smaller varieties.</li>
		<li>Golden Midget The rind of the stunning golden midget, a mini weighing only three pounds, turns yellow when ripe. Elwyn Meader and Albert Yeager, well-known breeders at the University of New Hampshire, developed the variety in 1959.
			ADVERTISING</li>
			<li>starlight The pristine, amaranth-colored fruit of this mini cultivar glistens with juice. It's easily transportable—and deeply satisfying.</li>
			<li>Jubilee Developed in 1963, this popular, supersweet cultivar may weigh up to 45 pounds, so it ranks as a giant, a classification conferred on watermelons exceeding 32 pounds at full ripeness.</li>
			<li>Starbrite The bright pink, medium-firm flesh of this variety, a descendant of the charleston gray and the crimson sweet, is perfect for pureeing into granitas or sorbets.</li>
			<li>Extazy The pint-size extazy is a seedless melon that averages five pounds and is grown mostly in California and Arizona.</li>
			<li>Stars 'n' Stripes This hybrid, named for the green stripes streaking across its rind, has an elongated shape and can weigh as much as 30 pounds; it is well loved for its firm, sweet, deeply colored flesh.</li>
			<li>Mickylee A lovely, speckled rind and dense red flesh characterize this 22-year-old seedless variety, which averages 12 pounds.</li>
			<li>Yellow Baby This hybrid is similar to yellow doll in its rind pattern and the color of its flesh; try the tender fruit in a salsa made with jalapeño and tomatillo.</li>
			<li>Yellow Doll Weighing no more than eight pounds, this extra-sweet, golden-fleshed mini has especially soft fruit, which makes it an excellent ingredient for smoothies and iced cocktails.</li>
			<li>Little Baby Flower This petite, pink-fleshed cultivar ripens quickly and never exceeds four pounds.</li>
			<li>Crimson Sweet The amply proportioned crimson sweet is famous for its sugary, bright red flesh; it is a cross of the charleston gray, miles, and peacock varieties and has a honeyed taste that pleasantly offsets feta and mint.</li>
			<li>Pixie This miniature, seedless melon averages only six pounds and has thick stripes along its rind; the succulent pixie is part of a breeding trend that favors very sweet, seedless fruit.</li>
		</li>
